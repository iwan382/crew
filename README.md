# crew

We use the apache library too write data to an excel file. 

If you do not have that library installed it can be found here: https://poi.apache.org/

The excel file contains the raw data that was collected. If you want to simulate many games at once the programm will write to the TheCrewData.xlsx file.
Make sure that this file exists and is located here D:/downloads/TheCrewData.xlsx
